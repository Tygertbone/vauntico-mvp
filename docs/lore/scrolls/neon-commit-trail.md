### Technical Patterns
- **HMAC Security**: Webhooks sealed with cryptographic validation
- **Token Authentication**: Runtime workflows protected
- **Dynamic Status**: Contributor logic flowing through all pages
- **Lore Documentation**: Every commit tells a story

### Ritual Commits
- Emojis as sacred markers (🧩, 🔐, 🌀, 🧿)
