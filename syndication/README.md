## ðŸŽ¨ Design System

All packages adhere to the **Vauntico Aesthetic**:

### Color Palette
```css
--vauntico-gold: #FFD700    /* Primary brand color */
--vauntico-pink: #FF1493    /* Accent color */
--background: #000000        /* Foundation darkness */
--foreground: #FFFFFF        /* Pure light text */
```

### Principles
1. **Dark Theme Foundation**: All interfaces emerge from darkness
2. **Gold as Light**: Vauntico Gold guides attention and hierarchy
3. **Spiritual UX**: Every interaction feels intentional and sacred
4. **Minimal but Rich**: Simple structures, deep meaning
