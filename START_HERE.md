## 🎯 3 Simple Steps to Deploy

### Step 1: Add Environment Variables (2 minutes)
On your Vercel import screen, add these **6 REQUIRED** variables:

VITE_APP_URL=https://vault.vauntico.com
VITE_NOTION_EMBED_URL=[your_notion_url]
VITE_PRODUCT_PRICE=97
VITE_CURRENCY=NGN
```

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Use **LIVE** Paystack keys (pk_live_ and sk_live_), not test keys!

### Step 2: Click Deploy (3 minutes)
1. Verify all settings on screen (already correct)
2. Click the **"Deploy"** button
3. Wait 2-4 minutes for build

### Step 3: Add Custom Domain (5 minutes)
1. Settings → Domains → Add Domain
2. Enter: `vault.vauntico.com`
3. Add CNAME record to DNS:
   ```
   Type: CNAME
   Name: vault
   Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
   ```

**Total Time: ~10 minutes to live site!**
